# ACT Rules for EPUB 

This repository contains sample [Accessibility Conformance Testing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/conformance-testing/wiki/ACT_Overview_-_What_is_ACT) rules targeted at EPUB publications.

The initial objective is to use these rules as proofs of concept that the ACT format works well in an EPUB context, and that EPUB-related rules can reuse the rules defined by the [ACT-Rules community](https://act-rules.github.io/pages/about).
