# Input Aspects

This document defines the input aspects used in the EPUB ACT Rules.

## ACT Common Input Aspects

Some EPUB ACT Rules, as well as the rules coming from the [ACT Rules community](https://act-rules.github.io/), use the aspects defined in the [_Common Input Aspects_ note](https://w3c.github.io/wcag-act/NOTE-act-rules-common-aspects.html) published by the W3C.

This note defines the following aspects:

- [HTTP Messages](https://w3c.github.io/wcag-act/NOTE-act-rules-common-aspects.html#input-aspects-http)
- [DOM Tree](https://w3c.github.io/wcag-act/NOTE-act-rules-common-aspects.html#input-aspects-dom)
- [CSS Styling](https://w3c.github.io/wcag-act/NOTE-act-rules-common-aspects.html#input-aspects-css)
- [Accessibility Tree](https://w3c.github.io/wcag-act/NOTE-act-rules-common-aspects.html#input-aspects-accessibility)
- [Language](https://w3c.github.io/wcag-act/NOTE-act-rules-common-aspects.html#input-aspects-text)

## Other aspects

### XML Document

An XML Document represented as a Document Node in the [XQuery and XPath Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel/) (XDM).

The means by which the XDM tree is constructed is not of importance. The rules rely on XDM as an unambiguous data model for XML.
